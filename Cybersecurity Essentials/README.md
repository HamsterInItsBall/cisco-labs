# Cybersecurity Essentials Labs 🚀

Welcome to my collection of hands-on labs from the **Cybersecurity Essentials** course!  
This repository documents my learning journey in networking security, device hardening, authentication systems, and secure network communication.

## 📚 Course Overview

The Cybersecurity Essentials course focuses on:
- Network fundamentals
- Device hardening
- Secure administrative access
- Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA)
- VPN and secure communication
- Basic security best practices

All labs were completed using real Cisco routers, switches, and PCs.  
I performed configuration, testing, troubleshooting, and documentation personally.

## 📎 Notes
- All configurations, reports, and documentation were created individually by me based on hands-on practice.
- Some labs were discussed and verified with peers during team activities, but main configuration and documentation were done independently.
- Labs follow Cisco Networking Academy learning objectives, but the explanations and outputs are my own work.
